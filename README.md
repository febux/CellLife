Application for simulating cell selection
This application is designed to simulate the behavior of cells in a population. The user can select from a variety of cell types, including empty cells, which represent the absence of a cell type, and energy, green, and red cells, which represent the different stages of a cell's life cycle.

The simulation is based on the concept of cellular automata, which is a mathematical model that describes how cells interact with each other and with their environment over time. In this simulation, the cells are represented as squares on a grid, and their behavior is determined by a set of rules that determine how cells change state based on the states of their neighboring cells.

The simulation can be run in either real-time or time-lapse mode, and the user can adjust the speed of the simulation, as well as the size of the grid and the number of cells in the population. The simulation also includes an option to save a screenshot of the simulation at regular intervals.

This application is designed to be a tool for exploring the principles of cellular automata and to provide a visual representation of complex systems that can be difficult to understand through traditional mathematical models.
